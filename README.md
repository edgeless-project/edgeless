# NextLess: Next Generation Serverless

This repository contains a research prototype of Nextless, a "next-generation" serverless system for edge computing scenarios.
It is focused on *orchestration-time abstractions and transformations*, the *integration of physical entities*, and *lightweight runtimes* to enable the execution of complex serverless applications on sets of heterogeneous and potentially resource constrained devices.

The initial focus lays on independent and locally-aggregated clusters of devices, with support for multi-cluster-deployments and cloud-backends defered for later.
