# EDGELESS Reference Implementation

This repository contains a research prototype of the EDGELESS platform, which is
under active development within the project [EDGELESS](https://edgeless-project.eu/).

*There currently are no guarantees on Stability and API-Stability!*

## Introduction

EDGELESS is a framework that enables _serverless edge computing_, which is
intended especially for edge nodes with limited capabilities.

![](documentation/architecture-arch-2.0.png)

An EDGELESS cluster consists of one or more _orchestration domains_ (three in
the example figure above) managed by an ε-CON (controller).

Users interact with the ε-CON to request the creation of _workflows_.
A workflow specifies how a number of functions and resources should interact
with one another to compose the service requested by the user by sending to one
another _asynchronous events_ that are akin to function invocations.
_Functions_ live entirely within the realm of the EDGELESS run-time, while
_resources_ may interact with the external environment, e.g., handling events
in a resource may have a side effect, such as updating an entry on an external
in-memory database or reading the value of a physical sensor.

Currently supported resources:

- http-ingress: to ingest of HTTP commands from external web clients;
- http-egress: to execute HTTP commands on external web servers;
- file-log: to save to a node-local file strings, optionally with timestamps;
- redis: to update a value on an external [Redis](https://redis.io/) server.

![](documentation/architecture-workflow.png)

Functions are _stateful_: a given function instance is assigned to exactly one
workflow, thus the function developer may assume that data will generally
remain available across multiple invocations on the same function instance.
However such state is:

- tied to the specific instance: if there are multiple instances for the same
function, then there is no consistency guarantee across the multiple states;
- ephemeral: if a function instance is terminated, then there is no effort to
save/persist the state.

Furthermore, unlike many other serverless computing platforms, workflows may
consist of a wide variety of function compositions, as illustrated below.

![](documentation/diagrams-workflows.png)

An orchestration domain contains:

- one ε-ORC (orchestrator) that manages the scaling of function instances and
  resources within its domain;
- one ε-BAL (balancer) that plays two roles:
  1) realization of an inter-domain data plane, to allow events generated by a
  function instance in an orchestration domain to be consumed by a function
  instance in another orchestration domain;
  1) configuration and management of the resources;
- one or more nodes, which can host the execution of function instances of a
  given workflow in a [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) run-time 
  environment or as a Docker container.

The byte code of the WASM function instance or the name of the Docker
container to be started is provided by the user when requesting
the creation of a workflow, which also includes _annotations_ to specify the
Quality of Service requirements (e.g., maximum completion time) and workload
characteristics (e.g, average invocation rate), as well as affinity of
functions to specific hardware properties (e.g., GPU required) or preference
for other system parameters (e.g., location, owner, price).
Depending on the annotations, the set of active workflows, and the current
system conditions, the ε-CON may reject the workflow creation request.

Some components/features are illustrated separately:

- [Orchestration model](documentation/orchestration.md)
- [Support of Docker containers](documentation/container-runtime.md)

### Known limitations

Currently there are several known limitations, including the following ones:

- the dataplane within an orchestration domain is realized through a full-mesh
  interconnection between all the nodes and the ε-BAL;
- the ε-CON only supports a single orchestration domain and does not perform
  any kind of admission control;
- no workflow-level annotations are supported; 
- the payload of events is not encrypted;
- the configuration of the ε-CON, ε-CON, and ε-BAL is read from a file and
cannot be modified (e.g., it is not possible to add an orchestration domain
or a node while running);
- there is no persistence of the soft states of the various components.

## How to build

See [building instructions](BUILDING.md).

## How to run

It is recommended that you enable at least info-level log directives with:

```
export RUST_LOG=info
```

To get the basic system running, first create the default configuration files
(they have fixed hardcoded values):

```
target/debug/edgeless_inabox -t 
target/debug/edgeless_cli -t cli.toml
```

which will create:

- `balancer.toml`
- `controller.toml`
- `node.toml`
- `orchestrator.toml`
- `cli.toml`

Then you can run the **EDGELESS-in-a-box**, which is a convenience binary that
runs every necessary component as one, using the generated configuration files:

```
target/debug/edgeless_inabox
```

Congratulations 🎉 now that you have a complete EDGELESS system you may want to check the the `examples/` directory, which contains several workflows/functions that are representative of the current EDGELESS features.

You can find [here](examples/README.md) the full list with a short description of each.
