# EDGELESS Reference Implementation

This repository contains a research prototype of the EDGELESS platform, which is
under active development within the project
[EDGELESS](https://edgeless-project.eu/) (2023-2025).

## Introduction

EDGELESS is a framework that enables
[serverless edge computing](documentation/serverless_edge_computing.md) and it
is intended especially for edge nodes with limited computational capabilities.

An EDGELESS cluster is managed by an Œµ-CON (controller) and consists of one
or more _orchestration domains_, each managed by an Œµ-ORC (orchestrator).

The Œµ-CON allows clients to request the creation of edge services (called
_workflows_), which consist of a collection of interconnected _functions_
and _resources_ and related annotations.
The management of the lifecycle of any such logical functions/resources is 
delegated by the Œµ-CON to one Œµ-ORC, which, in turn, manages the lifecycle
of physical function/resource instances on EDGELESS nodes.

Each EDGELESS node may offer multiple run-time environments (e.g., WebAssembly
or Docker) to run function instances and resource providers of different types
(e.g., file logs or Kafka) to create resource instances.

Orchestration in EDGELESS happens at two levels:

- _higher level orchestration_ is done by the Œµ-CON at cluster level
  and it maps logical functions/resources to orchestration domains;
- _lower level orchestration_ is done by the Œµ-ORC within its orchestration
  domain, and it maps every logical function/resource to physical instances
  on its nodes.

## How to build

See [building instructions](BUILDING.md).

## Quick start

It is recommended that you enable at least info-level log directives with:

```shell
export RUST_LOG=info
```

To get the basic system running, first create the default configuration files
(they have fixed hardcoded values):

```shell
target/debug/edgeless_inabox -t 
target/debug/edgeless_cli -t cli.toml
```

which will create:

- `balancer.toml`
- `controller.toml`
- `node.toml`
- `orchestrator.toml`
- `cli.toml`

Then you can run the **EDGELESS-in-a-box**, which is a convenience binary that
runs every necessary component as one, using the generated configuration files:

```
target/debug/edgeless_inabox
```

Congratulations üéâ now that you have a complete EDGELESS system you may check
our workflows/function examples, which are representative of the current
EDGELESS features:

- [Example workflows](examples/README.md)
- [Example functions](functions/README.md)

## Next steps

Basics:

- [Workflows, resources, and functions](documentation/basic_concepts.md)
- [Œµ-CON](documentation/controller.md)
- [Œµ-ORC](documentation/orchestrator.md)
- [EDGELESS node](documentation/node.md)
- [EDGELESS command-line clients](documentation/cli.md)
- [A step-by-step example](documentation/deploy_step_by_step.md)

Advanced topics:

- [Repository layout](documentation/repository_layout.md)
- [How to create a new function](documentation/rust_functions.md)
- [Local orchestration](documentation/local_orchestration.md)
- [Benchmarking EDGELESS](documentation/benchmark.md)
- [Docker container runtime](documentation/container-runtime.md)
- [A multi-domain example](documentation/example_multidomain.md)

## Known limitations

Currently there are several known limitations, including the following ones:

- The dataplane is limited within a single orchestration domain and realized
  through a full-mesh interconnection between all the nodes.
- The Œµ-BAL is a mere skeleton with no logic.
- The Œµ-CON allocates all the functions/resources of a workflow together to
  the same domain.
- No workflow-level annotations are supported.
- The payload of events is not encrypted.
- There is no persistence of the soft states of the various components.
- There currently are no guarantees on stability and API stability.
