## Introduction

EDGELESS is a framework that enables _serverless edge computing_, which is
intended especially for edge nodes with limited capabilities.

## Architecture Overview

![](figures/architecture-arch-2.0.png)

An EDGELESS cluster consists of one or more _orchestration domains_ (one in
the example figure above), managed by an ε-CON (controller).

An orchestration domain is made up of:

- **1 ε-ORC** (orchestrator) that manages the scaling of function instances and
  resources within its domain;
- **1 ε-BAL** (balancer) that plays two roles:
  1) realization of an inter-domain data plane, to allow events generated by a
  function instance in an orchestration domain to be consumed by a function
  instance in another orchestration domain;
  1) configuration and management of the resources;
- **$\ge$ 1 nodes**, which can host the execution of the function instances of a
  given workflow, either within a [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) run-time 
  environment or inside a [Docker container](deployment/).

### Workflows

Users interact with the ε-CON to request the creation of _workflows_.
A workflow specifies how a set of *functions* and *resources* should interact
with one another to compose the service requested by the user, by sending
_asynchronous events_ to each other that are akin to function invocations.

EDGELESS _functions_ live entirely within the realm of the EDGELESS run-time, while
_resources_ are capable of interacting with the external environment, e.g. handling events
in a resource may have a side effect, such as updating an entry in an external
in-memory database or reading the value of a physical sensor.

![](figures/architecture-workflow.png)

### Resources

Following their configuration fiels, EDGELESS nodes can host one or more
resource providers, but a node cannot have more than one resource of a given
type.
The resource provider ID in the configuration has a double purpose:

- if empty, then the resource provider is not created;
- otherwise, it is created and that's the identifier used.

The resource provider ID is used by the ε-ORC to identify the resource
providers, thus their names must be unique within an orchestration domain.
When deploying workflows, users can request that a resource instance is created
on a given resource provider using the `resource_match_all` annotation.
Imagine for instance that a resource provider is a digital twin for a physical
resource, e.g., a camera: it would very important for the user to be able to
identify precisely that resource provider.

The resource providers currently shipped with EDGELESS are reported in the table
below.

With `edgeless_node_d --available-resources` you can find the list of resource
providers that a node supports, along with the version, output channels, and
configuration parameters for each resource provider.

### Functions

Functions are _stateful_: a given function instance is assigned to exactly one
workflow, thus the function developer may assume that data will generally
remain available across multiple invocations on the same function instance.
However such state is:

- tied to the specific instance: if there are multiple instances for the same
function, then there is no consistency guarantee across the multiple states;
- ephemeral: if a function instance is terminated, then there is no effort to
save/persist the state.

Furthermore, unlike many other serverless computing platforms, workflows may
consist of a wide variety of function compositions, as illustrated below.

![](diagrams-workflows.png)

The byte code of the WASM function instance or the name of the Docker
container to be started is provided by the user when requesting
the creation of a workflow, which also includes _annotations_ to specify the
Quality of Service requirements (e.g., maximum completion time) and workload
characteristics (e.g, average invocation rate), as well as affinity of
functions to specific hardware properties (e.g., GPU required) or preference
for other system parameters (e.g., location, owner, price).
Depending on the annotations, the set of active workflows, and the current
system conditions, the ε-CON may reject the workflow creation request.

### Details

Some components/features are illustrated separately:

- [Orchestration model](orchestration.md)
- [Support of Docker containers](container-runtime.md)

### Known limitations

Currently there are several known limitations, including the following ones:

- the dataplane within an orchestration domain is realized through a full-mesh
  interconnection between all the nodes and the ε-BAL;
- the ε-CON only supports a single orchestration domain and does not perform
  any kind of admission control;
- no workflow-level annotations are supported; 
- the payload of events is not encrypted;
- the configuration of the ε-CON, ε-CON, and ε-BAL is read from a file and
cannot be modified (e.g., it is not possible to add an orchestration domain
or a node while running);
- there is no persistence of the soft states of the various components.

## How to build

See [building instructions](building.md).

## How to run

It is recommended that you enable at least info-level log directives with:

```
export RUST_LOG=info
```

To get the basic system running, first create the default configuration files
(they have fixed hardcoded values):

```
target/debug/edgeless_inabox -t 
target/debug/edgeless_cli -t cli.toml
```

which will create:

- `balancer.toml`
- `controller.toml`
- `node.toml`
- `orchestrator.toml`
- `cli.toml`

Then you can run the **EDGELESS-in-a-box**, which is a convenience binary that
runs every necessary component as one, using the generated configuration files:

```
target/debug/edgeless_inabox
```

Congratulations 🎉 now that you have a complete EDGELESS system you may want to check the the `examples/` directory, which contains several workflows/functions that are representative of the current EDGELESS features.

You can find [here](examples/README.md) the full list with a short description of each.
