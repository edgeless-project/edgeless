# edgeless_api

- files in the top-level of src define traits for all interfaces between the
  different components of edgeless (also known as inner traits)
- outer/ contains traits that put together the traits from top-level into
  composite traits, that directly map to s0X interfaces of edgeless
- every implementation has to implement the inner and outer traits
- TODO: add more info here


## TODO: add more info
- GuestAPIFunction - gets implemented by the concrete virtualization-technology
  function instance; acts as a gRPC server to the edgeless node's client, which
  allows it to manage the instance and interact with it; boot / init / cast /
  call / stop
- GuestAPIHost - implemented by the edgeless node; function instance connects to
  it as a client to perform actions like sending events or logging telemetry
  data

```

Legend:
- Function instance starts and runs a gRPC server for GuestAPIFunction.
- EDGELESS node connects to it to manage lifecycle and messaging.
- Function instance connects back to the nodeâ€™s GuestAPIHost to trigger cross-function operations or telemetry.
