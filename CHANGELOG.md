# Changelog

## [Unrelease]

New features:

- Add ε-CON support to multiple orchestration domains.
- Implement dynamic cluster formation, with domain capabilities announced by
  the ε-ORCs (periodically refreshed).
- Refactor orchestration domain formation: the keep-alive mechanism has been
  removed from the ε-ORC, substituted by nodes periodically refreshing their
  registration.

Improvements:

- Remove need for components to be started in a specific order. The ε-CON,
  ε-ORC, and nodes can be started independently and automatically reconnect
  if the connection with their peer is lost.
- Improve scalability of the ε-ORC by separating control vs. management
  operations.

API changes:

- Add service DomainRegistration.
- Update service NodeRegistration.
- Move node health status and performance samples from NodeManagement to
  NodeManagement.
- WorkflowInstance: return the list of workflow identifiers in list(); add new
  method inspect() to retrieve the workflow details.

## [1.0.0] - 2024-11-12

Initial stable release.

Notable features:
- multi-run-time support in nodes (WASM and Docker containers);
- resources supported: dda, file-log, http-egress, http-ingress,
  kafka-egress, ollama, redis;
- local observability supported at the ε-ORC through node telemetry;
- delegated orchestration implemented at the ε-ORC via a Redis proxy;
- benchmarking suite;

Notable limitations:
- the dataplane is limited within a single orchestration domain and realized
  through a full-mesh interconnection between all the nodes;
- the ε-BAL is a mere skeleton with no logic;
- the ε-CON only supports a single orchestration domain and does not perform
  any kind of admission control;
- no workflow-level annotations are supported; 
- the payload of events is not encrypted;
- the configuration of the ε-CON is read from a file and cannot be modified
  (e.g., it is not possible to add an orchestration domain);
- there is no persistence of the soft states of the various components.
