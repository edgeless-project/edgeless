# DDA crate

Implements methods that can be used within a function to interact with the DDA
resource.

# TODO:
- [ ] discuss only mapping incoming dda events to cast -> call does not make
  sense since there is noone to answer now
- [ ] provide overloads for all possible parameter values (slices, refs, etc.)
- [ ] add option to specify timeouts
- [ ] add publication on a topic (not over an alias)
