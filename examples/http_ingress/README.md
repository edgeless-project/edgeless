### HTTP hello world example

The example creates a chain of one function that waits for POST commands
matching a given host addressed to the balancer HTTP end-point and replies with
a 200 OK.

First, build the `http_processor` WASM binary following the [instructions](../../functions/README.md). 

Then you can start the workflow:

```
target/debug/edgeless_cli workflow start examples/http_ingress/workflow.json
```

and verify that it works with curl:

```
curl -H "Host: demo.edgeless.com" -XPOST http://127.0.0.1:7035/hello
```
