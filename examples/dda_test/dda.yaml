  # Name of agent.

  name: edgeless-dda-sidecar

  # Unique identifier of agent as a string.
  #
  # You may use a UUID v4 string to make identifiers globally unique among all
  # Data Distribution Agents within your system.
  #
  # If not present, default id is a UUID v4 newly generated at startup of the
  # DDA application.
  id:

# Identifies the application context in which the agent operates. Only agents
# within the same cluster can interact with each other in a DDA communication
# network. Multiple clusters can be run isolated from each other and in parallel
# in the same DDA communication network.
#
# Must be a string consisting of lower-case ASCII letters ('a' to 'z'),
# upper-case ASCII letters ('A' to 'Z'), ASCII digits ('0' to '9'), ASCII dot
# ('.'), ASCII hyphen (-), or ASCII underscore (_).
#
# If not present, default cluster name is "dda".

# Server-side configuration of public peripheral DDA Client APIs.
apis:
  # DDA gRPC service.
  grpc:
    # gRPC server address of gRPC API. When run inside Docker the port of the
    # given address must be exposed/mapped to the host system.
    #
    # The DDA gRPC server supports connections over TCP or Unix domain sockets.
    # Unix sockets provide fast, reliable, stable and low latency communication
    # between gRPC client and server co-located on the _same_ machine. Note that
    # a DDA sidecar hosted in a local container needs to share the configured
    # socket file via a volume.
    #
    # For TCP, the address string has the form "host:port". The port must be a
    # literal port number or a service name. If the host is empty or a literal
    # unspecified IP address, as in ":80", "0.0.0.0:80" or "[::]:80", the local
    # system is assumed.
    #
    # For Unix sockets, the address string has the form "unix:socketfile", e.g.
    # "unix:/tmp/mydda.sock".
    #
    # If not present, default address string is ":8900".
    address: :8900

    # Specify true to opt out from exposing this API service in your DDA. This
    # is useful if you embed the DDA as a library in your client application.

    # If not present, defaults to false.
    disabled:

    # After a duration of this time if the server doesn't see any activity it
    # pings the client to see if the transport is still alive. If set below 1s,
    # a minimum value of 1s will be used instead.
    #
    # If not present, defaults to 2 hours ("2h").
    #
    # Configuring gRPC HTTP/2 keepalives can be useful in a variety of
    # situations, including when sending data over a long-lived connection which
    # might be considered as idle by proxy or load balancers, when the network
    # is less reliable (e.g. mobile applications), when using a connection after
    # a long period of inactivity. Note that gRPC client-side and server-side
    # keepalives must be configured in a compatible way.
    #
    # A duration string is a sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional
    # fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time
    # units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
